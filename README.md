## Get the theme

Minimum Hugo Version: **0.82.1**

Run from the root of your Hugo site:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sscargal/fulltilt-hugo-theme themes/fulltilt
```

Alternatively, you can include this repository as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitsubmodules). This makes it easier to update this theme if you have your Hugo site in git as well:

```sh
git submodule add https://github.com/sscargal/fulltilt-hugo-theme.git themes/fulltilt
```

## Preview the theme with example content

Full Tilt theme ships with an fully configured example site. For a quick preview:

Copy the `package.json` file from `themes/fulltilt` folder to your hugo website root folder, and run `npm install`.

```sh
cd themes/fulltilt/exampleSite/
hugo serve --themesDir ../..
```

Then visit `http://localhost:1313/` in your browser to view the example site.

## Configuring theme to a hugo website

1. Copy `package.json` and `package-lock.json` to the root folder of your the website
2. Run `npm install` to install required packages for theme
3. Run `npm i -g postcss-cli` to use PostCSS with Hugo build
4. Set `theme = 'fulltilt'` in config.toml
5. Run `npm start` to start your local server

Make sure to commit the above changes to your repository.

## Publish your website

When deploying to services like Netlify or Vercel, use the following command for building your site:

```sh
npm i && HUGO_ENVIRONMENT=production hugo --gc
```
The parameter `HUGO_ENVIRONMENT=production` enables the execution of css purging.

## Add content

The following explains how to add content to your Hugo site. You can find sample content in the `exampleSite/` folder.

### Structure:

    .
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ blog       # Blog Section
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ post1   # Post 1
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ post2   # Post 2
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ _index
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...

## Configure your site

From `exampleSite/`, copy `config.toml` to the root folder of your Hugo site and change the fields as you like. Helpful comments are provided.

### Menu

Menu in Full Tilt theme is pre-set to have all section names. You can include custom links in header using the `menu.main` option config.toml.

### Logo

`logo` param in the site config will allow to use an image as the logo instead of the website name. It is localizable and so can have different logo for different languages

### Darkmode

`[params.darkModeToggle]` enables the dark mode toggle in header. The preference is then saved so that the mode is automatically chosen for return visits.

### Customize Ascent Color

Use `[params.ascentColor]` to change the default `pink` color to any supported color from the [list of default colors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors) from Tailwind CSS.

Some example values: bg-blue-200, bg-yellow-300

### Search

`[params.enableSearch]` option is used to enable search option in the theme.

- Adds the search icon in header
- Generates the search index
- Uses fuse.js to enable searching through content

In order to search, you can either click on the search icon from header or press `Ctrl/Cmd + /` key combination.

**Note:**

Make sure to enable JSON in outputs array.

```
[outputs]
  home = ["HTML", "RSS", "JSON"]
```

### Latex

Enable Mathematical options: set `math: true` in your markdown frontmatter

### Google Analytics

Set `googleAnalytics` in `config.toml` to activate Hugo's [internal Google Analytics template](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#google-analytics).
